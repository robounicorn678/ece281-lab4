LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell clockdiv_inst/f_count[30]_i_2__0, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) clockdiv_inst/f_count_reg[24]/CLR, clockdiv_inst/f_count_reg[25]/CLR,
clockdiv_inst/f_count_reg[26]/CLR, clockdiv_inst/f_count_reg[27]/CLR,
clockdiv_inst/f_count_reg[28]/CLR, clockdiv_inst/f_count_reg[29]/CLR,
clockdiv_inst/f_count_reg[2]/CLR, clockdiv_inst/f_count_reg[30]/CLR,
